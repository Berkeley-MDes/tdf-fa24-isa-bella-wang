# üóìÔ∏è Week 1 - Report 1 #
## Week of 09/02/2024

### Introduction

This week i laser cut 2 pill boxes out of plywood.

The idea was for me and my roomate to have a matching set. The flower shape gives a friendly and girly appearance.
The flower top spins around and snaps onto the open sections, leaving access to retrieve the contents.

We thought about 3d printing it, but decided aginst it because of the texture and cheap feel. The plywood gives a heavier sensation and a nicer finish.

### Process

1. Ai the layers
2. Cut the layers out of 3/4 plywood
3. Stack the layers with wood glue and clean up the edges
4. Sand the edges and surfaces


### Hiccups
1. We ran out of magnets and havent been able to test the mechanism.
2. I tried to sand off the burnt edges of the laser cut, but was dissapointed with the result. It looks patchy and oddly naked.

### Next steps

1. Purchase magnets and place them
2. Paint sides
3. Assemble the pill box
4. Put vitamins inside

### Diagrams

The diagrams were made by readign each of the nodes and identifying how they feed into each other. It was especially helpfull to understand that almost all parameters are customizable.
The designer has to create a system in which those nodes interact. Grasshopper allows to only define the overall arcitecture has to be defined. All minutia can be altered at any point. 

E.G.
In the current design, the smaller spehere remains substracted from the bigger sphere. But the designer is still able to change any size and alignment.
While the phone would be a headache to remove, the size, thickness and alignemnemt to the table can be easily altered.

### Baked forms

**First test:**
- Wanted a portrait mode phone
- This lead to thicker walls for balance. The ball on the backside grew until about half the phone height.
- The limits on threshhold caused the substracted cylinder to be shifted upwards.
- The phone distance from the table was shortened

**Second test:**
- Wanted a portrait mode phone
- This lead to thicker walls for balance. The ball on the backside grew until about half the phone height.
- The limits on threshhold caused the substracted cylinder to be shifted upwards.
- The phone distance from the table was shortened

**Third test:**
