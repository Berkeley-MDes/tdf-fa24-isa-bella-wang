# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week i laser cut 2 pill boxes out of plywood.

The idea was for me and my roomate to have a matching set. The flower shape gives a friendly and girly appearance.
The flower top spins around and snaps onto the open sections, leaving access to retrieve the contents.

We thought about 3d printing it, but decided aginst it because of the texture and cheap feel. The plywood gives a heavier sensation and a nicer finish.

Process:

1. Ai the layers
2. Cut the layers out of 3/4 plywood
3. Stack the layers with wood glue and clean up the edges
4. Sand the edges and surfaces
   
Hiccups:
1. We ran out of magnets and havent been able to test the mechanism.
2. I tried to sand off the burnt edges of the laser cut, but was dissapointed with the result. It looks patchy and oddly naked.

Next steps: 
1. find magnets
2. paint the sides
3. assemble the pill box
