# Week 1: Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week i laser cut 2 pill boxes out of plywood.

The idea was for me and my roomate to have a matching set. The flower shape gives a friendly and girly appearance.
The flower top spins around and snaps onto the open sections, leaving access to retrieve the contents.

We thought about 3d printing it, but decided aginst it because of the texture and cheap feel. The plywood gives a heavier sensation and a nicer finish.

<b>Process:</b>

1. Ai the layers
2. Cut the layers out of 3/4 plywood
3. Stack the layers with wood glue and clean up the edges
4. Sand the edges and surfaces


<b>Hiccups:</b>
1. We ran out of magnets and havent been able to test the mechanism.
2. I tried to sand off the burnt edges of the laser cut, but was dissapointed with the result. It looks patchy and oddly naked.
